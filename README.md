### Introduction

An agent is trained to navigate a square world. A reward of +1 is returned for collecting a yellow banana, while a score of -1 is returned for collecting a blue banana. The state space is 37 dimensions, containing the velocity and perception of the agent's forward direction. The action space is in 4 discrete dimensions, being move forward, backward, turn left, and turn right. An average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes solves this task.
